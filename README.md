My solution to different Katas from codewars.com.

Language: **JAVA**

Ranks are used to indicate the proficiency of users and the difficulty of Kata. There are two classes of ranks, **Kyu** and **Dan**, which are divided in 8 levels each. By increasing order of proficiency/difficulty:

**8 Kyu** to **1 Kyu**

**1 Dan** to **8 Dan**

Inside each rank folder, you'll find Katas I have solved.

Inside each Kata folder, there is a description of the Kata (the instructions) and my solution.

Note: most of the times, the Kata ask for a function only. But furthermore, I always include the main method, so that it is possible to run the whole project. Obviously, at the main method you can modify the parameters values.
